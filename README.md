# Semantic-Vision

This repository contains my personal project on Semantic Vision, which involves tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. The goal of this project is to develop advanced computer vision models and algorithms to perform accurate object detection and segmentation tasks on diverse datasets.

## Problem 1: Object Detection
In the first part of the project, we explore object detection using the state-of-the-art Detectron2 framework. We perform inference on images using pre-trained detectron2 models, visualize the predictions with different IoU thresholds, and analyze the results. Additionally, we train custom models on a chosen dataset and evaluate their performance using training and testing images.

## Problem 2: Semantic Segmentation
In the second part, we focus on semantic segmentation using Convolutional Neural Networks. The goal is to develop a network that can accurately segment images into different classes, such as balcony, window, pillar, facade, etc. We train a network on the Mini Facade dataset, report the detailed architecture of our model, evaluate its performance using validation and test sets, and showcase satisfactory segmentation results.

Please refer to the Jupyter Notebooks and code files for detailed implementations, model architectures, training configurations, and evaluation procedures for both object detection and semantic segmentation tasks.

## Usage
To run the code and reproduce the results:

Set up the required dependencies as mentioned in the installation instructions.
Follow the instructions provided in each problem's respective Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the code cells and visualize the results.
Refer to the generated PDF for detailed analysis, including images with predicted bounding boxes and semantic segmentation labels.
Feel free to explore the code, datasets, and documentation provided in this repository. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to reach out. Let's unlock the power of computer vision together!

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my gratitude to the developers and researchers who have contributed to the Detectron2 framework and the Mini Facade dataset, enabling us to explore and learn from these advanced computer vision techniques.
